# Readme requirements  

# R3 Provide full attribution to referenced sources (where applicable).

# R4 Provide a link to your source control repository

# Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.


# R6 Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .


# R7 Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 


> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
# R8. Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:

steps to install the application

any dependencies required by the application to operate

any system/hardware requirements

how to use any command line arguments made for the application -->

Usage

to use this you will need to have python3 installed

R10	An overview of your code	An explanation of the important parts of your code, including any crucial application logic


# R11 Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:
** - variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Python package
- using functions from a Python package**


# R12 Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

# R13 Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

# R14 Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

# R15 Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application

# R16 	Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
- pushing all commits to a remote repository

# R17 Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,
- writing a script which turns the application into an executable
