# Identify any code style guide or styling conventions that the application will adhere to.

Reference the chosen style guide appropriately.

# R6 Develop a list of features that will be included in the application. It must include:
- at least THREE features
- describe each feature

Note: Ensure that your features above allow you to demonstrate your understanding of the following language elements and concepts:
- use of variables and the concept of variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- error handling

Consult with your educator to check your features are sufficient .

# About 

This is a hotel booking system application that allows clients/users to view available rooms and make a booking. It also lets users check for previous bookings

#features
## Menu 
The first featue is the main menu that displays all the available features and functions of the program. This allows them to select their choices or to exit the program
Below is the discord discussion for this application.

## View and enter current user
This inputs the current user so it can be saved

## View available rooms and process 
This allows users to view the current available rooms and prices, it will also prompt the users if they want to make a booking or if they want to continue browsing

## Booking 
This allows the users to make a booking and choose the length of their stay 

## Booking records
This provides a list of the previously made bookings and the user who made the booking.

## Exit 
exits program

# R7 Develop an implementation plan which:
- outlines how each feature will be implemented and a checklist of tasks for each feature
- prioritise the implementation of different features, or checklist items within a feature
- provide a deadline, duration or other time indicator for each feature or checklist/checklist-item

Utilise a suitable project management platform to track this implementation plan.

Provide screenshots/images and/or a reference to an accessible project management platform used to track this implementation plan. 

I used trello to outline all the features, what needed to be prioritised and what is done. In the review section I added coding that was done but should be reviewed when there is time so I can add further features. The different coloured labels also indicates the priorities and what section it is in. The orange label for example is important and needs to be completed soon.

> Your checklists for each feature should have at least 5 items.
# R8. Design help documentation which includes a set of instructions which accurately describe how to use and install the application.

You must include:

steps to install the application

any dependencies required by the application to operate

any system/hardware requirements

how to use any command line arguments made for the application -->

## Usage
This program is best run on VSCODE on Windows which can be installed from here : https://code.visualstudio.com/download

### Python 

You can install the Python extension on VSCODE by going to Visual studio Marketplace. To use this program you will need to have python3 installed : https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial

You can check the python version by going to Terminal and typing: 
python3 -- version

# R11 Implement features in the software development plan you have designed. You must utilise a range of programming concepts and structures using Python such as:
** - variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a Python package
- using functions from a Python package**


# R12 Apply DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) coding principles to all code produced.

# R13 Apply all style and conventions for the programming language consistently to all code produced.

# R14 Creates an application which runs without error and has features that are consistent with the development plan.

# R15 Design TWO tests which check that the application is running as expected.

Each test should:
- cover a different feature of the application
- state what is being tested
- provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

> An outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of the application

Tested the application using Pytest and Monkeypatch to create a mock function to assert the results. This is in test_user.py


# R16 	Utilise source control throughout the development of the application by:
- making regular commits (at least 20 commits) with a commit message that summarises the changes
- pushing all commits to a remote repository

# R17 Utilise developer tools to facilitate the execution of the application:
For example,
- writing a script which turns the application into an executable
